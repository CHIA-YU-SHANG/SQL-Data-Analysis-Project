# SQL Data Analysis Portfolio: From Global Economics to Olympic Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a structured collection of SQL projects demonstrating my expertise in data engineering and business analytics. 

1. **Global Economic Integration**: Consolidating multi-source data (Economic indicators, currencies, and demographics) to identify regional trends.
2. **Olympic Historical Analytics**: Utilizing advanced Window Functions to track athlete performance and national growth over a century of data.

## 🛠️ Technical Skillset
* **Advanced Data Manipulation**: 
    * **Window Functions**: Expert use of `RANK`, `LAG/LEAD`, and `SUM() OVER` for time-series and competitive analysis.
    * **Moving Averages**: Implementation of sliding windows (`ROWS BETWEEN`) to smooth data fluctuations.
* **Complex Data Modeling**:
    * **Multi-Table Integration**: Mastering `LEFT/FULL JOIN` and `USING` clauses for clean, non-redundant data merging.
    * **Set Operations**: Using `UNION` to maintain consistency across historical datasets.
* **Business Reporting**: Leveraging `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` to generate hierarchical summaries and pivot-table-like reports directly in SQL.

## 📊 Analytical Insights (Examples)
* **Trend Identification**: Analyzed the "Moving Average" of medals to identify long-term national performance stability rather than single-year anomalies.
* **Succession Analysis**: Tracked gold medal retention (Defending Champions) across consecutive Olympic games using `LAG` functions.

## 🎓 Professional Context
I hold an **MSc in Business Analytics (Distinction)** from **Aston University**. This portfolio bridges the gap between academic theory and industry-level data manipulation, reflecting my experience in **Cryptocurrency price prediction** and **Python/Pandas** data processing.

## 💻 Tools Used
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **IDE**: pgAdmin 4 / SQL Shell
